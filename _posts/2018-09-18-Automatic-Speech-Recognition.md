# Automatic Speech Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) 은 사람의 음성과 기계간의 상호 작용을 꾀하기 위한 기술로, 다음과 같은 다양한 기술이 적용됩니다.
- Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
- hidden Markov models (HMMs)
- mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and their derivatives
- ngram language models (LMs)
- discriminative training, and various adaptation techniques
- GMM-HMM sequence discriminative training

이 책에서는 앞서 나열된 ASR 을 위한 기술들을 소개 및 설명하고 있습니다.
